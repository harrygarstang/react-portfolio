## Description 
In this portfolio, I showcase my skills and projects as a developer. The website is built using React and Bootstrap, and features a clean and modern design with easy navigation. The landing page provides a brief introduction about me, my skills and my experience. The portfolio page displays my projects with images and brief descriptions, while the contact page allows visitors to get in touch with me. My portfolio is a professional and visually appealing showcase of my work and skills as a developer.

### How to use this program 

* Firstly, access the Workday Planner web page at the following url: https://harrygarstang.github.io/Workday-Planner/

* Secondly, click the 'Click here to input your workday schedule' button 

* You will be prompted to enter firstly your time for the start of your working day, followed by another prompt requesting the time of the end of your working day. 

* Please provide these in 24 hour format. For example, if you're workday was 09:00 until 18:00 - this would be a start time of 9, and an end time of 18.

### What I have learnt 

* Implementing conditional rendering to show/hide components or content based on certain conditions.
* Utilising React Router to handle navigation between different pages in a single-page application.
* Writing reusable components to keep your code organized and DRY.
* Using props and state to pass data between components and manage application state.
