    "description": "Coffee Curator is an interactive front-end application that utilizes Bootstrap for its UI and makes use of two server-side APIs to generate its dynamic content. It also employs client-side storage for persistent data, and features a responsive and polished user interface. \nThe application accesses properties of objects, processes data using AJAX calls, accesses data on RESTful web APIs, and generates page elements based on API responses. This demonstrates an ability to build a real-world front-end application that requires collaborative coding.",
